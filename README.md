# Convolution-neural-network-to-identify-the-input-image-number-is-even-or-odd
Used MNIST dataset to train the classifier. Developed 2 convolutional and pooling layers with 32 and 64 filters of kernel size 5*5. Used Keras to build the CNN. Trained the CNN using MNIST dataset and then modified the CNN to read input image by the user and classify the number as even or odd.
